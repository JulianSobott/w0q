        <h2 class="text-3xl mb-4 mt-16">Privacy Policy</h2>

        <h3 class="text-2xl mb-4">Who is responsible?</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          The responsible party for this site and thus for the collection of your data is the operator of this website:
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">{{ .address }}</p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl mb-4">What data is collected when using this website?</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          This site is explicitly designed in such a way that (almost) no data is required from you for its operation. Only
          the usual log files are written to the server.
          <br />
          These include:
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc ml-8 mb-4">
          <li>your IP address</li>
          <li>the page you are visiting</li>
          <li>the time you accessed the page</li>
          <li>the page from which you were redirected to this site</li>
          <li>which browser and operating system you are using</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb-4">
          We use this data to be able to analyse how many (different) visitors visit our site at what time (and where they
          come from) and also to be able to trace where the accesses came from in the event of an attack.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Incidentally, the legal basis for collecting the data is, on the one hand, the enriched interest in Art. 6 para. 1
          lit. f DSGVO, in order to improve our website, and the fulfilment of a legal obligation in Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c
          DSGVO, as we need to ensure that we can react adequately in the event of an attack and evaluate this attack.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl mb-4">What happens with my data?</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          We use your data exclusively to learn something about the use of our website ourselves and, for example, to
          determine which of our articles are particularly interesting. We do not pass on the data to any third party at any
          time! We do use Netcup GmbH, a data centre provider who operates our servers on our behalf, but they do not have
          access to your data.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl mb-4">How long will my data be stored?</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          We store your data for a period of 12 months. The storage takes place exclusively on our servers in Germany.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl mb-4">How is my data protected?</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          It is very important to us that your data - even if it is only your IP address and your browser - is safe with us!
          That's why we use various techniques to protect it.
          <br />
          These include:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc ml-8 mb-4">
          <li>Use of a firewall on all servers</li>
          <li>use of encryption in transmission (SSL or TLS)</li>
          <li>careful selection of our administrators</li>
          <li>constant further training of those responsible</li>
          <li>regular updates of the server operating systems</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-2xl mb-4">What rights do I have?</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Of course, you have all the rights you are entitled to according to the DSGVO!
          <br />
          These include:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc ml-8 mb-4">
          <li>Right to deletion: If you wish, we will delete all data that we have collected from you at any time.</li>
          <li>Right to information: You can ask us at any time which of your data we have stored.</li>
          <li>Right to rectification: If the data we have collected is incorrect, you can always inform us and we will correct
            the errors.</li>
          <li>Right to transfer: If you wish, we can transfer the data we have collected to you.</li>
          <li>Right to restriction of processing: If you wish, we are happy to exclude your data from processing (in which
            case we would simply delete it)</li>
          <li>Right to complain: You can complain about us to a supervisory authority - we would of course be happy if you
            approached us first!</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb-4">
          All these rights are of course available to you free of charge!
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl mb-4">Who can I contact if I have any questions?</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          If you have any questions, we are always happy to receive an email from you! You can reach us by email at {{ .mail }}.
